                in different institutions of higher learning in Nigeria will be history. 
                What we are more concerned with now is the decline in educational value and 
                standard in our Secondary Schools Education, which is very glaring and now 
                worrisome more so when we realize that the future of our children is at stake 
                We have delayed our contribution till this moment because of the adage which say 
                that "A man does not test depth of the river with both feet together, our enviable 
                record in the primary school education is of no equal "A chicken may have feather 
                like the Eagle, but a Chicken may not fly like the Eagle. MODEL "HIS & HERS" COLLEGE 
                is a school established out of personal contribution towards the upliftment of the 
                standard of secondary school education in the state and the country at large. and 
                not out of greed of personal selfish interest as a profit making enterprise. We are 
                fully aware of the national policy on education and we have thoroughly and critically 
                examined every aspect of its content and we are ready to put into practice all it's laudable
                objectives.
